			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’m a junior undergraduate student studying Computer Science in
<a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> (SJTU).
I’m expected to graduate in 2022.</p>
<p>My real name is Chi Zhang. As the name is too common in Chinese culture, I’m generally
referred to as Alex Chi.</p>
<p>In my second year at SJTU, I applied for a research internship.
It turned out that the whole experience was a disaster for me. For half a year
I had nothing to do, except attending weekly lab meetups. I had no idea of what
the team was doing, and what I could do. I suffered a lot, questioning myself,
&ldquo;Am I qualified for this position?&rdquo; The next semester I quit that team.
Only then did I find myself more of an engineer than a researcher.</p>
<p>My past experience focuses on building system software with the Rust programming
language, especially storage systems. I built <a href="https://github.com/tikv/agatedb">AgateDB</a> during my
internship in PingCAP.
In addition to individual projects, I love becoming part of the open-source
community. I contributed to <a href="https://tikv.org">the TiKV project</a>, and I&rsquo;m
currently a maintainer at <a href="https://mirrors.sjtug.sjtu.edu.cn">SJTUG mirror</a>.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<h3 id="intern-at-pingcap-inc">Intern at PingCAP, Inc.</h3>
<p><em>August 2020 ~ January 2021</em></p>
<p>I built a key-value storage engine <a href="https://github.com/tikv/agatedb">AgateDB</a>.
Inspired by the WiscKey paper, AgateDB separates large values from the
LSM tree into a value log. This design leads to a 10x write speedup
on large values, compared with current storage engine used by TiKV.
AgateDB is a Rust port of <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger">BadgerDB</a>.</p>
<h3 id="contributor-in-tikv-community">Contributor in TiKV Community</h3>
<p><em>May 2020 ~ December 2020</em></p>
<p>I became part of the TiKV community as a <a href="https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org">Community Bridge</a> mentee. In
<a href="https://github.com/skyzh/tikv/issues/2">Full Chunk-based Computing</a> project, I migrated the TiKV coprocessor
to use the TiDB Chunk format during the computation process and added some
new features. Then, as community co-leader of the TiKV coprocessor, I
mentored <a href="https://github.com/Xuanwo">@Xuanwo</a> on <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/9066">Enum/Set support in TiKV</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ta-in-ppca-ray-tracing-project">TA in PPCA Ray-Tracing Project</h3>
<p><em>July 2020 ~ August 2020</em></p>
<p>Principle and Practice of Computer Algorithms (PPCA)
is a project-oriented course for first-year undergraduates,
where they use what they have learned to build a toy application
in one month. I mentored 13 students to make a ray-tracer with
the Rust programming language.</p>

<h3 id="maintainer-of-sjtug-mirror">Maintainer of SJTUG Mirror</h3>
<p><em>May 2019 ~ Now</em></p>
<p>Shanghai Jiao Tong University Linux User Group (<a href="https://github.com/sjtug/">SJTUG</a>)
sets up a public mirror of open-source software in China, which
serves 70k users and 1.5 million requests per day. I built
infrasturcture for the new <a href="https://github.com/sjtug/mirror-docker-siyuan">Siyuan</a> mirror server, which
enables on-demand mirroring with <a href="https://github.com/sjtug/mirror-intel">mirror-intel</a> and hosts
the first Flathub mirror in China.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>I enjoy making toy projects. This &ldquo;learn by doing&rdquo; process is so much fun. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/skyzh/core-os-riscv">core-os-riscv</a>, a toy operating system based on xv6 in Rust.</p>

<hr>
<p>The following things are necessary parts of an academic profile, but I don&rsquo;t think they are meaningful
to myself. From my perspective, what I&rsquo;ve actually done is more important than those scores and awards.</p>
<h2 id="academic-status">Academic Status</h2>
<ul>
<li>First 2.5 years GPA: 93.99/100 (Rank: 1/156)</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy studying courses in Computer Science, and I did well in most of them.</p>

<p>National Scholarship (Ministry of Education of P.R. China), 2019</p>
<p>I was also qualified for National Scholarship in 2020, but I gave that chance to
my classmates. It&rsquo;s boring to get the same award every year.</p>
