      <description>Introduction I‚Äôm a junior undergraduate student studying Computer Science in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I‚Äôm expected to graduate in 2022.
My real name is Chi Zhang. As the name is too common in Chinese culture, I‚Äôm generally referred to as Alex Chi.
In my second year at SJTU, I applied for a research internship. It turned out that the whole experience was a disaster for me. For half a year I had nothing to do, except attending weekly lab meetups.</description>
